# Chinook database dbt project

## Overview

This is a project to showcase the ELT tool dbt's functionalities from basic to advanced concepts. For this configuration, I am trying out dbt cloud as my experience with the tool has been using the CLI. 

## Data 

The source data is the Chinook database. I have the data stored in a Google BigQuery instance, which serves as the source and destination data warehouse for this project.
